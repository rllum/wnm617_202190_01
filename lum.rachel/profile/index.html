	<p>I am a Bay Area native who is excited about crafting authentic and intriguing experiences through applied research and product design. I believe that effective design is powered by thoughtful research. I hold a B.S. in Cognitive Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) from the University of California, Santa Cruz. I am currently pursuing a Masters degree in Webs Design and New Media from the Academy of Art University in San Fransisco, CA.</p>
